# Name Entity Recognition - Flask API

![](rest_api.gif)

This is my fist capstone project at Algoritma School of Data Sciece. In this project I created a Name Entity Recognition API to identify different entities in text and categorize them into pre-defined classes or types such as: person, geopolitical, organization, money, and organization.
